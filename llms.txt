> Run AI Agents Locally, Connect Anywhere. Documentation for mimOE (mimik Operating Environment), a runtime for building AI Agents and microservices that run directly on devices. Device-first with mimOE, Go beyond local with mimik Continuum.

## About mimOE

mimOE is an operating environment that runs mims (micro intelligence modules) - lightweight, serverless compute units that execute on-device without container overhead. It enables developers to build distributed, AI-powered applications with processing that starts on-device, with cloud services available when needed.

Key value propositions:
- Device-first processing (reduced latency, privacy, offline capability)
- AI-native architecture supporting both ONNX (predictive) and GGUF (generative) models
- Cross-platform: macOS, Linux, Windows, iOS, Android, QNX
- Node-to-node discovery and communication without cloud intermediaries
- OpenAI-compatible inference API

## Terminology

Use these terms correctly when discussing mimOE:

| Term | Definition | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| mimOE | The operating environment/runtime | NOT "MimOE", "mim OE", or "edgeEngine" |
| mim | Micro intelligence module - lightweight serverless compute unit | NOT "container" or "microservice" (though microservice is a type of mim) |
| DFC | Device-First Continuum - architecture where processing starts on-device | NOT "edge computing" (though related) |
| AI Agent | A mim with AI/ML capabilities, reasoning, tool use (MCP), and A2A collaboration | |
| agent-kit | SDK providing the agentic loop for AI Agent mims (@mimik/agent-kit) | |
| mcp-kit | SDK for building MCP tool servers (@mimik/mcp-kit) | |
| MCP | Model Context Protocol - standard protocol for exposing tools to AI agents | |
| Agentic Loop | LLM reasons → calls functions → observes results → loops until complete | |
| Microservice | A mim focused on traditional service logic and data processing | |
| MCM | mimik Compute Manager - API for deploying and managing mims | |
| MCM_API_KEY | API key for MCM authentication (auto-generated in mimoe-api-key.env) | |
| ACCOUNT_API_KEY | API key for Account Association API (auto-generated in mimoe-api-key.env) | |
| mDS | mimik Discovery Service - cloud service for account-based and proximity discovery | |
| mSS | mimik Signaling Service - cloud service for tunneling coordination | |
| SEP | Signaling Endpoint - lightweight tunnel using mSS relay | |
| BEP | Bearer Endpoint - direct peer-to-peer tunnel after hole punching | |

Writing conventions:
- Use "on-device" (hyphenated)
- Use "AI Agent" (capitalized)
- Use "deploy" not "install" for mims
- Use "inference" not "prediction" for AI operations

### API Key File
mimOE auto-generates an API key file (`mimoe-api-key.env`) on first startup containing:

- `MCM_API_KEY`: For MCM API

The file is created in the working directory and persists across restarts. No developer console signup required for MCM access.

## Key Concepts

### AI Agent mims

Building an AI Agent mim means implementing four things:
1. **API Handler**: HTTP endpoints, ideally following standard protocols (OpenAI chat completions, A2A)
2. **Instructions**: System prompt defining agent behavior in natural language
3. **MCP Endpoints**: Tool sources - agent-kit only accepts tools via MCP protocol
4. **Context Retrieval**: Fetch from mkb (RAG) or edis (data), inject into instructions

Why build AI Agents as mims (vs LangChain, etc.)?
- **Dynamic Deployment**: Deploy programmatically via MCM API
- **Automatic Discovery**: Reach MCP servers on other devices without hardcoding URLs
- **Cross-Platform**: Same code runs on mobile, Jetson, desktop - no setup
- **Decoupled from UI**: Agent becomes a service, discoverable by any client

### Serverless Execution Model
Mims are instantiated on-demand per request and terminated after. No state persists between requests. Use `context.storage` for persistence.

### Two-Step Model Provisioning
1. Create metadata: `POST /models` with id, version, kind, config
2. Provision file: Either `POST /models/{id}/upload` or `POST /models/{id}/download`

### Model Formats
- **GGUF**: Generative AI (LLMs, chat, embeddings) - llama.cpp ecosystem
- **ONNX**: Predictive AI (classification, regression, vision) - cross-framework

### Discovery Modes
- **Link Local**: Same network, no cloud, mDNS-based supernode election
- **Account-Based**: Your nodes across networks, requires mDS
- **Proximity**: Nearby nodes (other users), location-based, requires mDS

### mimik Continuum (Go Beyond Local)
mimik Continuum provides cloud services to extend mimOE beyond link-local networks:
- **Fleet Management**: Deploy, update, and monitor mimOE instances across networks from a central dashboard
- **mimik Continuum Identity**: Federate local device identities with cloud identity providers for seamless authentication
- **Fleet Observability**: Metrics, logging, and tracing across your distributed AI agent fleet

mimOE runtime is free. mimik Continuum services are available for applications that need to go beyond link-local.

### Developer Journey
Entry Point A (AI Foundation Addon): Stage 0 (Just Run It) → Stage 1 (Customize) → Stage 2 (Distribute)
Entry Point B (Platform): Full mim development with JavaScript or WASM

## Quick Start Commands

### One-Liner Install (Recommended)

macOS / Linux:
```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mimik-mimOE/mimOE-SE/main/install-mimOE-ai.sh | bash
```

Windows (Command Prompt):
```cmd
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mimik-mimOE/mimOE-SE/main/install-mimOE-ai.bat -o install.bat && install.bat
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
curl.exe -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mimik-mimOE/mimOE-SE/main/install-mimOE-ai.bat -o install.bat; .\install.bat
```

The install script downloads mimOE, installs the AI Foundation Addon, and provisions a default model (SmolLM2-360M). Once complete, the API is ready at http://localhost:8083.

### Manual Model Provisioning

```bash
# Create model metadata
curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/mimik-ai/store/v1/models \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 1234" \
  -d '{"id": "my-model", "version": "1.0.0", "kind": "llm"}'

# Download model from Hugging Face
curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/mimik-ai/store/v1/models/my-model/download \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 1234" \
  -d '{"url": "https://huggingface.co/..."}'
```

### Run Inference

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/mimik-ai/openai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 1234" \
  -d '{"model": "my-model", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Complete this sentence: AI is like a"}]}'
```

### Stop mimOE

macOS / Linux:
```bash
pkill -f mimoe
```

Windows:
```cmd
taskkill /f /im mimoe.exe
```
